this project is about OOP , we will discuss different aspect of OOP here 
In these project we discuss about Converse of longURL to shortURL and shortURL to longURL
Why is it necessary to short URLs?
The link has a huge meaning cause there can find page parameters sort options and etc. Also, marketers use UTM, and it makes the URL longer in times. It is an inconvenient way to send such a kind of URL. Sometimes even messengers, blogs and forums don't support these monstrously long links. 

How does URL shortener work?
All you need to do is to enter your long URL and get its short version. The short URL is constantly connected with the main one. It will be like a link's mirror. So you don't need to worry about that link will stop to work. Forgot or lost your short URL? No problem, just enter your long URL again.
